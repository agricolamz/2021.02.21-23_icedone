<p>Привет, дорогие пацаны и пацанессы!</p>
<p>День второй, вы, предположительно, поразвлекались с регулярками, жизнь продолжается, давайте же анализировать тексты!</p>
<p>В этом эпизоде сериала АйсДан мы выясним, как обычно выглядят текстовые данные (и откуда их, кстати, брать!), как мы хотим, чтобы текстовые данные выглядели, и как перевести одно в другое. Бонус: смешные графики!</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pi4_LNX4IyY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
<p>Для начала давайте установим нужные библиотеки:</p>
<div id="загрузка-текста-в-r" class="section level2" number="5.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Загрузка текста в R</h2>
<p>В пакете <code>readr</code>, который входит в <code>tidyverse</code>, есть функция <code>read_lines()</code>. Такая же по сути функция есть в base R, она называется <code>readLines()</code>, но она работает гораздо медленнее, так что мы ей пользоваться не будем.</p>
<p><code>read_lines()</code> принимает на вход путь к файлу с текстом на вашем компьютере или ссылку на файл в Интернете. Например, у Гарика на гитхабе есть документ с текстом книги Теда Чана “История твоей жизни” (судя по Википедии, это научно-фантастическая повесть о лингвистке, изучающей язык пришельцев. Звучит прикольно). Давайте считаем этот файл.</p>

[6] &quot;танцевать! — объявляю я, и твой отец подтрунивает надо мной, но мы начинаем скользить в&quot; </code></pre>
<p><code>read_lines()</code> создал вектор строк:</p>

<pre><code>[1] &quot;character&quot;</code></pre>
<p>В каждом элементе вектора у нас содержится одна строчка (в смысле, line) из книги. Чтобы превратить текст в единое целое, воспользуемся уже известной нам функцией <code>str_c()</code> из библиотеки <code>stringr</code>, и склеим, используя пробел как разделитель.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb193"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb193-1"><a href="работа-с-текстами-gutenbergr-tidytext-stopwords-udpipe.html#cb193-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>t2 <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> stringr<span class="sc">::</span><span class="fu">str_c</span>(t, <span class="at">collapse =</span> <span class="st">&quot; &quot;</span>)</span>

<pre><code>[1] 117398</code></pre>
<p>При таком слиянии стоит проверить, не было ли в анализируемом тексте знаков переноса, иначе они сольются неправильно:</p>

<p>В этой библиотеке нас интересуют две вещи: объект <code>gutenberg_metadata</code>, в котором хранится информация о всех книгах, которые есть в библиотеке, и функция <code>gutenberg_download()</code>, которая позволяет их скачивать. Начнём с первого.</p>

He lived","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"about a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from their","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"mutual connexions in London. He had returned to a late dinner, after","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"some days' absence, and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"well in Brunswick Square. It was a happy circumstance, and animated","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Mr. Woodhouse for some time. Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"always did him good; and his many inquiries after \"poor Isabella\" and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"her children were answered most satisfactorily.

It was a concern which","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"brought just employment enough.

He had, by that time, realised an easy","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"competence--enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Highbury, which he had always longed for--enough to marry a woman as","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"portionless even as Miss Taylor, and to live according to the wishes of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"his own friendly and social disposition.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"schemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"purchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to;","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"but he had gone steadily on, with these objects in view, till they were","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"accomplished. He had made his fortune, bought his house, and obtained","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"his wife; and was beginning a new period of existence, with every","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through.

It was most unlikely, therefore,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"that he should ever want his father's assistance. His father had no","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"apprehension of it. The aunt was a capricious woman, and governed her","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"husband entirely; but it was not in Mr. Weston's nature to imagine that","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear, and, as he","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"believed, so deservedly dear. He saw his son every year in London, and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"was proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fine young man","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too.

Now","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"was the time for Mr. Frank Churchill to come among them; and the hope","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"mother on the occasion. For a few days, every morning visit in Highbury","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"included some mention of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had received.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"I suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"has written to Mrs. Weston?

She felt herself a most","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"fortunate woman; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"she might well be thought, where the only regret was for a partial","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled, and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"who could ill bear to part with her.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"She knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think, without","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"pain, of Emma's losing a single pleasure, or suffering an hour's ennui,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"from the want of her companionableness: but dear Emma was of no feeble","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"character; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"have been, and had sense, and energy, and spirits that might be hoped","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"privations. And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Randalls from Hartfield, so convenient for even solitary female walking,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and in Mr. Weston's disposition and circumstances, which would make the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the week together.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Weston, and of moments only of regret; and her satisfaction--her more","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"than satisfaction--her cheerful enjoyment, was so just and so apparent,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"that Emma, well as she knew her father, was sometimes taken by surprize","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"at his being still able to pity 'poor Miss Taylor,' when they left her","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort, or saw her go away","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"own.

She loved every body,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"was interested in every body's happiness, quicksighted to every body's","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"merits; thought herself a most fortunate creature, and surrounded with","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"blessings in such an excellent mother, and so many good neighbours","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and friends, and a home that wanted for nothing. The simplicity and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"cheerfulness of her nature, her contented and grateful spirit, were a","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"recommendation to every body, and a mine of felicity to herself. She was","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"a great talker upon little matters, which exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"full of trivial communications and harmless gossip.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Mrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School--not of a seminary, or an","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"establishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"refined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"upon new principles and new systems--and where young ladies for enormous","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity--but a real,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable quantity of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and where girls might","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"be sent to be out of the way, and scramble themselves into a little","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"education, without any danger of coming back prodigies. Mrs. Goddard's","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"school was in high repute--and very deservedly; for Highbury was","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"reckoned a particularly healthy spot: she had an ample house and garden,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"gave the children plenty of wholesome food, let them run about a great","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"deal in the summer, and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"hands.

Quick","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging, and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"telling her to come very often; and as their acquaintance increased, so","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"did their satisfaction in each other. As a walking companion, Emma had","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"very early foreseen how useful she might find her. In that respect","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Mrs. Weston's loss had been important. Her father never went beyond the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"walk, or his short, as the year varied; and since Mrs. Weston's marriage","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"her exercise had been too much confined. She had ventured once alone to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Randalls, but it was not pleasant; and a Harriet Smith, therefore,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"one whom she could summon at any time to a walk, would be a valuable","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"addition to her privileges. But in every respect, as she saw more of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"her, she approved her, and was confirmed in all her kind designs.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Harriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile, grateful","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"disposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring to be","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"guided by any one she looked up to. Her early attachment to herself","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"was very amiable; and her inclination for good company, and power of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"appreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that there was no","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"want of taste, though strength of understanding must not be expected.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith's being exactly the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"young friend she wanted--exactly the something which her home required.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Such a friend as Mrs. Weston was out of the question. Two such could","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"never be granted. Two such she did not want. It was quite a different","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"sort of thing, a sentiment distinct and independent. Mrs. Weston was the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem. Harriet","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"would be loved as one to whom she could be useful. For Mrs. Weston there","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"was nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"were the parents, but Harriet could not tell. She was ready to tell","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"every thing in her power, but on this subject questions were vain. Emma","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"was obliged to fancy what she liked--but she could never believe that in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the same situation _she_ should not have discovered the truth. Harriet","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"had no penetration. She had been satisfied to hear and believe just what","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her; and looked no farther.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Mrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the school in general, formed naturally a great part of the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"conversation--and but for her acquaintance with the Martins of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Abbey-Mill Farm, it must have been the whole. But the Martins occupied","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"her thoughts a good deal; she had spent two very happy months with them,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit, and describe","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the many comforts and wonders of the place. Emma encouraged her","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"talkativeness--amused by such a picture of another set of beings,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"exultation of Mrs. Martin's having \"_two_ parlours, two very good","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"parlours, indeed; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard's","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"drawing-room; and of her having an upper maid who had lived","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"five-and-twenty years with her; and of their having eight cows, two of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"them Alderneys, and one a little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welch","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"cow indeed; and of Mrs. Martin's saying as she was so fond of it,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"it should be called _her_ cow; and of their having a very handsome","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"summer-house in their garden, where some day next year they were all to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"drink tea:--a very handsome summer-house, large enough to hold a dozen","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"people.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"For some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the immediate","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"cause; but as she came to understand the family better, other feelings","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"arose. She had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"daughter, a son and son's wife, who all lived together; but when it","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"appeared that the Mr. Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, and was","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"always mentioned with approbation for his great good-nature in doing","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"something or other, was a single man; that there was no young Mrs.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Martin, no wife in the case; she did suspect danger to her poor little","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"friend from all this hospitality and kindness, and that, if she were not","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"taken care of, she might be required to sink herself forever.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"With this inspiriting notion, her questions increased in number and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"meaning; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and there was evidently no dislike to it. Harriet was very ready to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"games; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good-humoured and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"obliging. He had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"some walnuts, because she had said how fond she was of them, and in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"every thing else he was so very obliging. He had his shepherd's son into","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her. She was very fond","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of singing. He could sing a little himself. She believed he was very","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"clever, and understood every thing. He had a very fine flock, and, while","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"she was with them, he had been bid more for his wool than any body in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the country. She believed every body spoke well of him. His mother and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"sisters were very fond of him. Mrs. Martin had told her one day (and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"there was a blush as she said it,) that it was impossible for any body","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to be a better son, and therefore she was sure, whenever he married, he","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"would make a good husband. Not that she _wanted_ him to marry. She was","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"in no hurry at all.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Well done, Mrs. Martin!\" thought Emma. \"You know what you are about.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"And when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Mrs. Goddard a beautiful goose--the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had ever","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"seen.

I was very much pleased with all that he said. I never hear","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"better sense from any one than Robert Martin. He always speaks to the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"purpose; open, straightforward, and very well judging. He told me every","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"thing; his circumstances and plans, and what they all proposed doing in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the event of his marriage. He is an excellent young man, both as son and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"brother. I had no hesitation in advising him to marry. He proved to me","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"that he could afford it; and that being the case, I was convinced he","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"could not do better. I praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"him away very happy. If he had never esteemed my opinion before, he","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"would have thought highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the house","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had. This happened","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the night before last. Now, as we may fairly suppose, he would not allow","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"much time to pass before he spoke to the lady, and as he does not appear","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely that he should be at Mrs.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Goddard's to-day; and she may be detained by a visitor, without thinking","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"him at all a tiresome wretch.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Pray, Mr. Knightley,\" said Emma, who had been smiling to herself","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"through a great part of this speech, \"how do you know that Mr. Martin","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"did not speak yesterday?\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Certainly,\" replied he, surprized, \"I do not absolutely know it; but it","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"may be inferred.

She is the natural daughter of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"nobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision at all, and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"certainly no respectable relations. She is known only as parlour-boarder","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"at a common school. She is not a sensible girl, nor a girl of any","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"information. She has been taught nothing useful, and is too young and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"too simple to have acquired any thing herself. At her age she can have","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"no experience, and with her little wit, is not very likely ever to have","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"any that can avail her. She is pretty, and she is good tempered, and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"that is all. My only scruple in advising the match was on his account,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"as being beneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him. I felt that,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"as to fortune, in all probability he might do much better; and that as","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to a rational companion or useful helpmate, he could not do worse. But I","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"could not reason so to a man in love, and was willing to trust to there","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"being no harm in her, to her having that sort of disposition, which, in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"good hands, like his, might be easily led aright and turn out very well.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"The advantage of the match I felt to be all on her side; and had not the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"smallest doubt (nor have I now) that there would be a general cry-out","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"upon her extreme good luck. Even _your_ satisfaction I made sure of.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"It crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend's","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"leaving Highbury, for the sake of her being settled so well.

If we feel for the wretched, enough to do all we can","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"for them, the rest is empty sympathy, only distressing to ourselves.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Harriet could just answer, \"Oh! dear, yes,\" before the gentleman joined","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"them. The wants and sufferings of the poor family, however, were the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"first subject on meeting. He had been going to call on them. His visit","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"he would now defer; but they had a very interesting parley about","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"what could be done and should be done. Mr. Elton then turned back to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"accompany them.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"To fall in with each other on such an errand as this,\" thought Emma;","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"to meet in a charitable scheme; this will bring a great increase","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of love on each side. I should not wonder if it were to bring on the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"declaration. It must, if I were not here. I wish I were anywhere else.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could, she soon","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath, a little raised on one","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"side of the lane, leaving them together in the main road. But she had","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"not been there two minutes when she found that Harriet's habits of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"dependence and imitation were bringing her up too, and that, in short,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"they would both be soon after her. This would not do; she immediately","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"stopped, under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of her half-boot, and stooping down in complete occupation of the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"footpath, begged them to have the goodness to walk on, and she would","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"follow in half a minute. They did as they were desired; and by the time","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot, she had the comfort","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of farther delay in her power, being overtaken by a child from the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"cottage, setting out, according to orders, with her pitcher, to fetch","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"broth from Hartfield. To walk by the side of this child, and talk to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and question her, was the most natural thing in the world, or would have","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"been the most natural, had she been acting just then without design;","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead, without","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"any obligation of waiting for her. She gained on them, however,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"involuntarily: the child's pace was quick, and theirs rather slow;","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and she was the more concerned at it, from their being evidently in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"a conversation which interested them. Mr. Elton was speaking with","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"animation, Harriet listening with a very pleased attention; and Emma,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"having sent the child on, was beginning to think how she might draw back","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"a little more, when they both looked around, and she was obliged to join","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"them.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Mr. Elton was still talking, still engaged in some interesting detail;","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday's party at his","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"friend Cole's, and that she was come in herself for the Stilton cheese,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the north Wiltshire, the butter, the celery, the beet-root, and all the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"dessert.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"This would soon have led to something better, of course,\" was her","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"consoling reflection; \"any thing interests between those who love; and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart. If I","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"could but have kept longer away!\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"They now walked on together quietly, till within view of the vicarage","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"pales, when a sudden resolution, of at least getting Harriet into the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"house, made her again find something very much amiss about her boot, and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"fall behind to arrange it once more. She then broke the lace off short,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and dexterously throwing it into a ditch, was presently obliged to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"entreat them to stop, and acknowledged her inability to put herself to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Part of my lace is gone,\" said she, \"and I do not know how I am to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"contrive. I really am a most troublesome companion to you both, but I","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"hope I am not often so ill-equipped. Mr. Elton, I must beg leave to stop","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"at your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"or any thing just to keep my boot on.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Mr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothing could","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage. The room they were","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"taken into was the one he chiefly occupied, and looking forwards; behind","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"it was another with which it immediately communicated; the door between","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"them was open, and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"her assistance in the most comfortable manner. She was obliged to leave","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the door ajar as she found it; but she fully intended that Mr. Elton","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"should close it. It was not closed, however, it still remained ajar; but","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation, she hoped to make","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"room. For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself. It could be","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"protracted no longer. She was then obliged to be finished, and make her","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"appearance.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"The lovers were standing together at one of the windows. It had a most","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"favourable aspect; and, for half a minute, Emma felt the glory of having","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"schemed successfully. But it would not do; he had not come to the point.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"He had been most agreeable, most delightful; he had told Harriet that","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"he had seen them go by, and had purposely followed them; other little","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"gallantries and allusions had been dropt, but nothing serious.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Cautious, very cautious,\" thought Emma; \"he advances inch by inch, and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Still, however, though every thing had not been accomplished by her","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"ingenious device, she could not but flatter herself that it had been","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the occasion of much present enjoyment to both, and must be leading them","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"forward to the great event.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"CHAPTER XI","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Mr. Elton must now be left to himself. It was no longer in Emma's power","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures. The coming of her","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"sister's family was so very near at hand, that first in anticipation,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and then in reality, it became henceforth her prime object of interest;","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield it was not to be","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"expected--she did not herself expect--that any thing beyond occasional,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers. They might","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"advance rapidly if they would, however; they must advance somehow or","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"other whether they would or no. She hardly wished to have more leisure","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"for them. There are people, who the more you do for them, the less they","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"will do for themselves.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, from having been longer than usual absent","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"from Surry, were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Till this year, every long vacation since their marriage had been","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey; but all the holidays of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"this autumn had been given to sea-bathing for the children, and it was","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Surry connexions, or seen at all by Mr. Woodhouse, who could not be","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"induced to get so far as London, even for poor Isabella's sake; and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"forestalling this too short visit.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"He thought much of the evils of the journey for her, and not a little","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of the party the last half of the way; but his alarms were needless;","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the sixteen miles being happily accomplished, and Mr. and Mrs. John","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Knightley, their five children, and a competent number of nursery-maids,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"all reaching Hartfield in safety. The bustle and joy of such an arrival,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the many to be talked to, welcomed, encouraged, and variously dispersed","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and disposed of, produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"not have borne under any other cause, nor have endured much longer even","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"for this; but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"were so respected by Mrs. John Knightley, that in spite of maternal","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones, and for their","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"having instantly all the liberty and attendance, all the eating and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"drinking, and sleeping and playing, which they could possibly wish for,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"without the smallest delay, the children were never allowed to be long","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"a disturbance to him, either in themselves or in any restless attendance","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"on them.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Mrs. John Knightley was a pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle, quiet","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"manners, and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate; wrapt","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"up in her family; a devoted wife, a doating mother, and so tenderly","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"attached to her father and sister that, but for these higher ties, a","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"warmer love might have seemed impossible. She could never see a fault","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"in any of them. She was not a woman of strong understanding or any","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"quickness; and with this resemblance of her father, she inherited also","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"much of his constitution; was delicate in her own health, over-careful","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of that of her children, had many fears and many nerves, and was as fond","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of her own Mr. Wingfield in town as her father could be of Mr. Perry.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"They were alike too, in a general benevolence of temper, and a strong","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"habit of regard for every old acquaintance.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Mr. John Knightley was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever man;","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"rising in his profession, domestic, and respectable in his private","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"character; but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"pleasing; and capable of being sometimes out of humour. He was not an","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"ill-tempered man, not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"reproach; but his temper was not his great perfection; and, indeed, with","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"such a worshipping wife, it was hardly possible that any natural defects","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"in it should not be increased. The extreme sweetness of her temper","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"must hurt his. He had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"wanted, and he could sometimes act an ungracious, or say a severe thing.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"He was not a great favourite with his fair sister-in-law. Nothing wrong","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"in him escaped her. She was quick in feeling the little injuries to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Isabella, which Isabella never felt herself. Perhaps she might have","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"passed over more had his manners been flattering to Isabella's sister,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend, without","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"praise and without blindness; but hardly any degree of personal","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into, the want of respectful","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"forbearance towards her father. There he had not always the patience","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"that could have been wished. Mr. Woodhouse's peculiarities and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"sharp retort equally ill-bestowed. It did not often happen; for Mr. John","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Knightley had really a great regard for his father-in-law, and generally","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"a strong sense of what was due to him; but it was too often for Emma's","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"charity, especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to be endured, though the offence came not. The beginning, however, of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"every visit displayed none but the properest feelings, and this being of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"They had not been long seated and composed when Mr. Woodhouse, with a","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"melancholy shake of the head and a sigh, called his daughter's attention","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to the sad change at Hartfield since she had been there last.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Ah, my dear,\" said he, \"poor Miss Taylor--It is a grievous business.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Oh yes, sir,\" cried she with ready sympathy, \"how you must miss her!","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"And dear Emma, too!--What a dreadful loss to you both!--I have been so","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"grieved for you.--I could not imagine how you could possibly do without","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"her.--It is a sad change indeed.--But I hope she is pretty well, sir.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Pretty well, my dear--I hope--pretty well.--I do not know but that the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"place agrees with her tolerably.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Mr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any doubts","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of the air of Randalls.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Oh! no--none in the least.

She had frequently","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"thought--especially since his father's marriage with Miss Taylor--that","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"if she _were_ to marry, he was the very person to suit her in age,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"character and condition.

I always make a point of reading Jane's letters through","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to myself first, before I read them aloud to my mother, you know, for","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"fear of there being any thing in them to distress her. Jane desired me","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to do it, so I always do: and so I began to-day with my usual caution;","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"but no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell, than I","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"burst out, quite frightened, with 'Bless me! poor Jane is ill!'--which","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"my mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly, and was sadly alarmed","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"at. However, when I read on, I found it was not near so bad as I had","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"fancied at first; and I make so light of it now to her, that she does","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"not think much about it. But I cannot imagine how I could be so off my","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"guard. If Jane does not get well soon, we will call in Mr. Perry. The","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"expense shall not be thought of; and though he is so liberal, and so","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"fond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"attendance, we could not suffer it to be so, you know. He has a wife and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"family to maintain, and is not to be giving away his time. Well, now I","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"have just given you a hint of what Jane writes about, we will turn to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"her letter, and I am sure she tells her own story a great deal better","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"than I can tell it for her.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"I am afraid we must be running away,\" said Emma, glancing at Harriet,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and beginning to rise--\"My father will be expecting us.

These were claims which","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"he did not learn to overlook, though some years passed away from the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"death of poor Fairfax, before his own return to England put any thing in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"his power. When he did return, he sought out the child and took notice","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of her. He was a married man, with only one living child, a girl, about","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Jane's age: and Jane became their guest, paying them long visits and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"growing a favourite with all; and before she was nine years old, his","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"daughter's great fondness for her, and his own wish of being a real","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"friend, united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of undertaking","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the whole charge of her education. It was accepted; and from that period","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell's family, and had lived with them","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"entirely, only visiting her grandmother from time to time.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others; the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"independence impossible.

She had fallen into good hands, known","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"nothing but kindness from the Campbells, and been given an excellent","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"education. Living constantly with right-minded and well-informed people,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and culture; and Colonel Campbell's residence being in London, every","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"lighter talent had been done full justice to, by the attendance of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"first-rate masters. Her disposition and abilities were equally worthy","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of all that friendship could do; and at eighteen or nineteen she was,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"fully competent to the office of instruction herself; but she was too","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"much beloved to be parted with. Neither father nor mother could promote,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and the daughter could not endure it. The evil day was put off. It was","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"easy to decide that she was still too young; and Jane remained with","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"them, sharing, as another daughter, in all the rational pleasures of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"an elegant society, and a judicious mixture of home and amusement, with","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"only the drawback of the future, the sobering suggestions of her own","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"good understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"The affection of the whole family, the warm attachment of Miss","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Campbell in particular, was the more honourable to each party from","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the circumstance of Jane's decided superiority both in beauty and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"acquirements. That nature had given it in feature could not be unseen","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"by the young woman, nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"parents. They continued together with unabated regard however, till the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"marriage of Miss Campbell, who by that chance, that luck which so often","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs, giving attraction to what is","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"moderate rather than to what is superior, engaged the affections of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Mr. Dixon, a young man, rich and agreeable, almost as soon as they were","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"acquainted; and was eligibly and happily settled, while Jane Fairfax had","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"yet her bread to earn.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"This event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing to be","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of duty; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"fixed on for beginning. She had long resolved that one-and-twenty","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"should be the period. With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate, she had","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"resolved at one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice, and retire from","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"all the pleasures of life, of rational intercourse, equal society, peace","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and hope, to penance and mortification for ever.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"The good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"a resolution, though their feelings did. As long as they lived, no","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"exertions would be necessary, their home might be hers for ever; and for","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"their own comfort they would have retained her wholly; but this would","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"be selfishness:--what must be at last, had better be soon. Perhaps they","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"temptation of any delay, and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished. Still, however,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"on the wretched moment. She had never been quite well since the time of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"their daughter's marriage; and till she should have completely recovered","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"her usual strength, they must forbid her engaging in duties, which, so","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"seemed, under the most favourable circumstances, to require something","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"tolerable comfort.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"With regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland, her account to her","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"aunt contained nothing but truth, though there might be some truths","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"not told. It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Highbury; to spend, perhaps, her last months of perfect liberty with","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"those kind relations to whom she was so very dear: and the Campbells,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"whatever might be their motive or motives, whether single, or double, or","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"treble, gave the arrangement their ready sanction, and said, that they","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"depended more on a few months spent in her native air, for the recovery","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of her health, than on any thing else. Certain it was that she was to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"come; and that Highbury, instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"had been so long promised it--Mr. Frank Churchill--must put up for the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"present with Jane Fairfax, who could bring only the freshness of a two","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"years' absence.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Emma was sorry;--to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"through three long months!--to be always doing more than she wished,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and less than she ought! Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"difficult question to answer; Mr. Knightley had once told her it was","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman, which she","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"wanted to be thought herself; and though the accusation had been eagerly","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"refuted at the time, there were moments of self-examination in which","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"her conscience could not quite acquit her. But \"she could never get","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"acquainted with her: she did not know how it was, but there was such","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"coldness and reserve--such apparent indifference whether she pleased or","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"not--and then, her aunt was such an eternal talker!--and she was made","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"such a fuss with by every body!--and it had been always imagined that","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"they were to be so intimate--because their ages were the same, every","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"body had supposed they must be so fond of each other.\" These were her","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"reasons--she had no better.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"It was a dislike so little just--every imputed fault was so magnified","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"by fancy, that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"considerable absence, without feeling that she had injured her; and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"now, when the due visit was paid, on her arrival, after a two years'","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"interval, she was particularly struck with the very appearance and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"manners, which for those two whole years she had been depreciating. Jane","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Fairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and she had herself the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"highest value for elegance. Her height was pretty, just such as almost","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"every body would think tall, and nobody could think very tall; her","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"figure particularly graceful; her size a most becoming medium, between","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"fat and thin, though a slight appearance of ill-health seemed to point","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"out the likeliest evil of the two. Emma could not but feel all this; and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"then, her face--her features--there was more beauty in them altogether","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"than she had remembered; it was not regular, but it was very pleasing","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"beauty. Her eyes, a deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and eyebrows, had","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"never been denied their praise; but the skin, which she had been used to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"cavil at, as wanting colour, had a clearness and delicacy which really","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"needed no fuller bloom. It was a style of beauty, of which elegance was","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the reigning character, and as such, she must, in honour, by all her","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"principles, admire it:--elegance, which, whether of person or of mind,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"she saw so little in Highbury. There, not to be vulgar, was distinction,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and merit.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"In short, she sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane Fairfax with","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"twofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"justice, and was determining that she would dislike her no longer. When","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"she took in her history, indeed, her situation, as well as her beauty;","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"when she considered what all this elegance was destined to, what she was","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"going to sink from, how she was going to live, it seemed impossible","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to feel any thing but compassion and respect; especially, if to every","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"well-known particular entitling her to interest, were added the highly","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"so naturally started to herself. In that case, nothing could be more","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr. Dixon's","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"actions from his wife, or of any thing mischievous which her imagination","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"had suggested at first. If it were love, it might be simple, single,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"successless love on her side alone. She might have been unconsciously","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"sucking in the sad poison, while a sharer of his conversation with her","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"friend; and from the best, the purest of motives, might now be","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"denying herself this visit to Ireland, and resolving to divide herself","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"laborious duty.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Upon the whole, Emma left her with such softened, charitable feelings,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"as made her look around in walking home, and lament that Highbury","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence; nobody that she","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"could wish to scheme about for her.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"These were charming feelings--but not lasting. Before she had committed","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane Fairfax,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors, than","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"saying to Mr. Knightley, \"She certainly is handsome; she is better than","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"handsome!\" Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with her grandmother","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and aunt, and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Former provocations reappeared. The aunt was as tiresome as ever; more","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"tiresome, because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of her powers; and they had to listen to the description of exactly how","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"little bread and butter she ate for breakfast, and how small a slice","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of mutton for dinner, as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"workbags for her mother and herself; and Jane's offences rose again.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"They had music; Emma was obliged to play; and the thanks and praise","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"which necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour, an","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"air of greatness, meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"superior performance. She was, besides, which was the worst of all, so","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"cold, so cautious! There was no getting at her real opinion. Wrapt up in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"a cloak of politeness, she seemed determined to hazard nothing. She was","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"disgustingly, was suspiciously reserved.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"If any thing could be more, where all was most, she was more reserved on","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing. She seemed bent","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"on giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon's character, or her own value","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"for his company, or opinion of the suitableness of the match. It was all","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"general approbation and smoothness; nothing delineated or distinguished.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"It did her no service however. Her caution was thrown away. Emma saw","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"its artifice, and returned to her first surmises. There probably _was_","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"something more to conceal than her own preference; Mr. Dixon, perhaps,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"had been very near changing one friend for the other, or been fixed only","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to Miss Campbell, for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"The like reserve prevailed on other topics.

By that time, it was beginning to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"hold up, and I was determined that nothing should stop me from getting","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"away--and then--only think!--I found he was coming up towards me","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"too--slowly you know, and as if he did not quite know what to do; and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"so he came and spoke, and I answered--and I stood for a minute, feeling","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"dreadfully, you know, one can't tell how; and then I took courage, and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"said it did not rain, and I must go; and so off I set; and I had not got","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"three yards from the door, when he came after me, only to say, if I was","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"going to Hartfield, he thought I had much better go round by Mr. Cole's","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"stables, for I should find the near way quite floated by this rain. Oh!","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"dear, I thought it would have been the death of me! So I said, I was","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"very much obliged to him: you know I could not do less; and then he went","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"back to Elizabeth, and I came round by the stables--I believe I did--but","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"I hardly knew where I was, or any thing about it. Oh! Miss Woodhouse,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"I would rather done any thing than have it happen: and yet, you know,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"so kindly.

The young man's conduct, and his sister's, seemed","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the result of real feeling, and she could not but pity them. As Harriet","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"described it, there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and genuine delicacy in their behaviour. But she had believed them to be","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"well-meaning, worthy people before; and what difference did this make","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"in the evils of the connexion? It was folly to be disturbed by it. Of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"course, he must be sorry to lose her--they must be all sorry. Ambition,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"as well as love, had probably been mortified. They might all have hoped","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to rise by Harriet's acquaintance: and besides, what was the value of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Harriet's description?--So easily pleased--so little discerning;--what","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"signified her praise?","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"She exerted herself, and did try to make her comfortable, by considering","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"all that had passed as a mere trifle, and quite unworthy of being dwelt","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"on,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"It might be distressing, for the moment,\" said she; \"but you seem to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"have behaved extremely well; and it is over--and may never--can never,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"as a first meeting, occur again, and therefore you need not think about","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"it.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Harriet said, \"very true,\" and she \"would not think about it;\" but still","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"she talked of it--still she could talk of nothing else; and Emma, at","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"last, in order to put the Martins out of her head, was obliged to hurry","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"on the news, which she had meant to give with so much tender caution;","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry, ashamed or only","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"amused, at such a state of mind in poor Harriet--such a conclusion of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Mr. Elton's importance with her!","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Mr. Elton's rights, however, gradually revived.

Sometimes Mr. Elton","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"predominated, sometimes the Martins; and each was occasionally useful","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"as a check to the other. Mr. Elton's engagement had been the cure of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the agitation of meeting Mr. Martin. The unhappiness produced by the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"knowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by Elizabeth","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Martin's calling at Mrs. Goddard's a few days afterwards. Harriet had","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"not been at home; but a note had been prepared and left for her, written","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"in the very style to touch; a small mixture of reproach, with a great","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"deal of kindness; and till Mr. Elton himself appeared, she had been much","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"occupied by it, continually pondering over what could be done in return,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and wishing to do more than she dared to confess. But Mr. Elton, in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"person, had driven away all such cares.

If he were deficient there, nothing should make amends","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"for it. But on seeing them together, she became perfectly satisfied. It","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"duty; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"her--nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"a friend and securing her affection. And there was time enough for Emma","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to form a reasonable judgment, as their visit included all the rest of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the morning. They were all three walking about together for an hour","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"or two--first round the shrubberies of Hartfield, and afterwards","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"in Highbury. He was delighted with every thing; admired Hartfield","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"sufficiently for Mr. Woodhouse's ear; and when their going farther was","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"resolved on, confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"village, and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Emma could have supposed.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings. He","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long, and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"which had been the home of his father's father; and on recollecting that","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"an old woman who had nursed him was still living, walked in quest of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"her cottage from one end of the street to the other; and though in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit, they","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"shewed, altogether, a good-will towards Highbury in general, which must","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"be very like a merit to those he was with.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Emma watched and decided, that with such feelings as were now shewn, it","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"himself; that he had not been acting a part, or making a parade of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"insincere professions; and that Mr. Knightley certainly had not done him","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"justice.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Their first pause was at the Crown Inn, an inconsiderable house, though","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the principal one of the sort, where a couple of pair of post-horses","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"were kept, more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"run on the road; and his companions had not expected to be detained by","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"any interest excited there; but in passing it they gave the history of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the large room visibly added; it had been built many years ago for","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"a ball-room, and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"populous, dancing state, had been occasionally used as such;--but such","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"brilliant days had long passed away, and now the highest purpose for","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"among the gentlemen and half-gentlemen of the place. He was immediately","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"interested. Its character as a ball-room caught him; and instead of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"passing on, he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"windows which were open, to look in and contemplate its capabilities,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and lament that its original purpose should have ceased. He saw no fault","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"in the room, he would acknowledge none which they suggested. No, it","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"was long enough, broad enough, handsome enough. It would hold the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"very number for comfort. They ought to have balls there at least every","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"fortnight through the winter. Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the former good old days of the room?--She who could do any thing in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Highbury! The want of proper families in the place, and the conviction","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to attend, were mentioned; but he was not satisfied. He could not be","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"persuaded that so many good-looking houses as he saw around him, could","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting; and even when particulars","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"were given and families described, he was still unwilling to admit that","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing, or that there","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"would be the smallest difficulty in every body's returning into their","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"proper place the next morning. He argued like a young man very much bent","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"on dancing; and Emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the Weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the Churchills.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"He seemed to have all the life and spirit, cheerful feelings, and social","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"inclinations of his father, and nothing of the pride or reserve of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Enscombe. Of pride, indeed, there was, perhaps, scarcely enough; his","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"indifference to a confusion of rank, bordered too much on inelegance of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"mind. He could be no judge, however, of the evil he was holding cheap.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"It was but an effusion of lively spirits.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"At last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown;","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and being now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged, Emma","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"recollected his intended visit the day before, and asked him if he had","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"paid it.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Yes, oh! yes\"--he replied; \"I was just going to mention it.

If the talking aunt had taken","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"me quite by surprize, it must have been the death of me. As it was, I","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit. Ten minutes","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"would have been all that was necessary, perhaps all that was proper; and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"I had told my father I should certainly be at home before him--but there","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"was no getting away, no pause; and, to my utter astonishment, I found,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"when he (finding me nowhere else) joined me there at last, that I had","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"been actually sitting with them very nearly three-quarters of an hour.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"The good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking?\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Ill, very ill--that is, if a young lady can ever be allowed to look","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"ill.

Where","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"features were indifferent, a fine complexion gave beauty to them all;","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and where they were good, the effect was--fortunately he need not","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"attempt to describe what the effect was.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Well,\" said Emma, \"there is no disputing about taste.--At least you","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"admire her except her complexion.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"He shook his head and laughed.--\"I cannot separate Miss Fairfax and her","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"complexion.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Did you see her often at Weymouth?

Vanity,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"extravagance, love of change, restlessness of temper, which must be","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"doing something, good or bad; heedlessness as to the pleasure of his","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"father and Mrs. Weston, indifferent as to how his conduct might appear","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"in general; he became liable to all these charges. His father only","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"called him a coxcomb, and thought it a very good story; but that Mrs.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Weston did not like it, was clear enough, by her passing it over as","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"quickly as possible, and making no other comment than that \"all young","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"people would have their little whims.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"With the exception of this little blot, Emma found that his visit","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him. Mrs. Weston","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"himself--how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether. He","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"appeared to have a very open temper--certainly a very cheerful and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"lively one; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions, a great deal","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"decidedly right; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard, was fond of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"talking of him--said he would be the best man in the world if he were","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"left to himself; and though there was no being attached to the aunt, he","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"acknowledged her kindness with gratitude, and seemed to mean always to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"speak of her with respect. This was all very promising; and, but for","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut, there was nothing to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"had given him; the honour, if not of being really in love with her,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of being at least very near it, and saved only by her own","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"indifference--(for still her resolution held of never marrying)--the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"honour, in short, of being marked out for her by all their joint","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"acquaintance.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Mr. Weston, on his side, added a virtue to the account which must","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"have some weight. He gave her to understand that Frank admired her","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"extremely--thought her very beautiful and very charming; and with so","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"much to be said for him altogether, she found she must not judge him","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"harshly. As Mrs. Weston observed, \"all young people would have their","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"little whims.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"There was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry, not so","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"leniently disposed. In general he was judged, throughout the parishes of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Donwell and Highbury, with great candour; liberal allowances were made","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"for the little excesses of such a handsome young man--one who smiled so","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"often and bowed so well; but there was one spirit among them not to be","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"softened, from its power of censure, by bows or smiles--Mr. Knightley.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"The circumstance was told him at Hartfield; for the moment, he was","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"silent; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"over a newspaper he held in his hand, \"Hum! just the trifling, silly","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"fellow I took him for.\" She had half a mind to resent; but an instant's","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"own feelings, and not meant to provoke; and therefore she let it pass.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings, Mr. and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Mrs. Weston's visit this morning was in another respect particularly","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"opportune. Something occurred while they were at Hartfield, to make Emma","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"want their advice; and, which was still more lucky, she wanted exactly","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the advice they gave.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"This was the occurrence:--The Coles had been settled some years in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Highbury, and were very good sort of people--friendly, liberal, and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"unpretending; but, on the other hand, they were of low origin, in trade,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and only moderately genteel. On their first coming into the country,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"they had lived in proportion to their income, quietly, keeping little","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"company, and that little unexpensively; but the last year or two had","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"brought them a considerable increase of means--the house in town had","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"yielded greater profits, and fortune in general had smiled on them. With","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"their wealth, their views increased; their want of a larger house, their","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"inclination for more company. They added to their house, to their number","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of servants, to their expenses of every sort; and by this time were,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"in fortune and style of living, second only to the family at Hartfield.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Their love of society, and their new dining-room, prepared every body","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"for their keeping dinner-company; and a few parties, chiefly among the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"single men, had already taken place. The regular and best families Emma","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"could hardly suppose they would presume to invite--neither Donwell, nor","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Hartfield, nor Randalls. Nothing should tempt _her_ to go, if they did;","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and she regretted that her father's known habits would be giving","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"her refusal less meaning than she could wish. The Coles were very","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"respectable in their way, but they ought to be taught that it was not","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"them. This lesson, she very much feared, they would receive only from","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"herself; she had little hope of Mr. Knightley, none of Mr. Weston.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"But she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"before it appeared, that when the insult came at last, it found her","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"very differently affected. Donwell and Randalls had received their","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"invitation, and none had come for her father and herself; and Mrs.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Weston's accounting for it with \"I suppose they will not take the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"liberty with you; they know you do not dine out,\" was not quite","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"sufficient. She felt that she should like to have had the power of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"refusal; and afterwards, as the idea of the party to be assembled there,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her, occurred","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"again and again, she did not know that she might not have been tempted","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to accept. Harriet was to be there in the evening, and the Bateses. They","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"had been speaking of it as they walked about Highbury the day before,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence. Might","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"not the evening end in a dance? had been a question of his. The bare","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits; and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"her being left in solitary grandeur, even supposing the omission to be","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"intended as a compliment, was but poor comfort.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Hartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though her first","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"remark, on reading it, was that \"of course it must be declined,\" she so","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do, that their","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"advice for her going was most prompt and successful.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"She owned that, considering every thing, she was not absolutely","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"without inclination for the party. The Coles expressed themselves so","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"properly--there was so much real attention in the manner of it--so much","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"consideration for her father. \"They would have solicited the honour","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"earlier, but had been waiting the arrival of a folding-screen from","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"London, which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"air, and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of his company.\" Upon the whole, she was very persuadable; and it being","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"his comfort--how certainly Mrs. Goddard, if not Mrs. Bates, might be","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"depended on for bearing him company--Mr. Woodhouse was to be talked","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"into an acquiescence of his daughter's going out to dinner on a day now","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"near at hand, and spending the whole evening away from him. As for _his_","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"going, Emma did not wish him to think it possible, the hours would be","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"too late, and the party too numerous. He was soon pretty well resigned.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"I am not fond of dinner-visiting,\" said he--\"I never was. No more is","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Emma. Late hours do not agree with us. I am sorry Mr. and Mrs. Cole","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"should have done it. I think it would be much better if they would come","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"in one afternoon next summer, and take their tea with us--take us","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"in their afternoon walk; which they might do, as our hours are so","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"reasonable, and yet get home without being out in the damp of the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"evening. The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"body to. However, as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"with them, and as you will both be there, and Mr. Knightley too, to take","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"care of her, I cannot wish to prevent it, provided the weather be what","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"it ought, neither damp, nor cold, nor windy.\" Then turning to Mrs.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Weston, with a look of gentle reproach--\"Ah! Miss Taylor, if you had not","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"married, you would have staid at home with me.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Well, sir,\" cried Mr. Weston, \"as I took Miss Taylor away, it is","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"incumbent on me to supply her place, if I can; and I will step to Mrs.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Goddard in a moment, if you wish it.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"But the idea of any thing to be done in a _moment_, was increasing,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"not lessening, Mr. Woodhouse's agitation. The ladies knew better how","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to allay it. Mr. Weston must be quiet, and every thing deliberately","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"arranged.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"With this treatment, Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"as usual. \"He should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard. He had a great regard","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"for Mrs. Goddard; and Emma should write a line, and invite her. James","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"could take the note.

Shall I?--Yes, I will--I declare I will--and you","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"shall see how she takes it;--whether she colours.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"He was gone immediately; and Emma soon saw him standing before Miss","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Fairfax, and talking to her; but as to its effect on the young lady,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them, exactly in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"front of Miss Fairfax, she could absolutely distinguish nothing.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Before he could return to his chair, it was taken by Mrs. Weston.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"This is the luxury of a large party,\" said she:--\"one can get near","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"every body, and say every thing. My dear Emma, I am longing to talk","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to you. I have been making discoveries and forming plans, just like","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"yourself, and I must tell them while the idea is fresh. Do you know how","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Miss Bates and her niece came here?\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"How?--They were invited, were not they?\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Oh! yes--but how they were conveyed hither?--the manner of their","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"coming?\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"They walked, I conclude. How else could they come?\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Very true.--Well, a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"it would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again, late at night, and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"cold as the nights are now. And as I looked at her, though I never saw","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"her appear to more advantage, it struck me that she was heated, and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"would therefore be particularly liable to take cold. Poor girl! I could","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"not bear the idea of it; so, as soon as Mr. Weston came into the room,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and I could get at him, I spoke to him about the carriage. You may guess","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"how readily he came into my wishes; and having his approbation, I made","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"my way directly to Miss Bates, to assure her that the carriage would be","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"at her service before it took us home; for I thought it would be making","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"her comfortable at once. Good soul! she was as grateful as possible, you","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"may be sure. 'Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself!'--but with many,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"many thanks--'there was no occasion to trouble us, for Mr. Knightley's","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"carriage had brought, and was to take them home again.' I was quite","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"surprized;--very glad, I am sure; but really quite surprized. Such a","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"very kind attention--and so thoughtful an attention!--the sort of thing","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"that so few men would think of. And, in short, from knowing his","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"usual ways, I am very much inclined to think that it was for their","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"accommodation the carriage was used at all. I do suspect he would not","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"have had a pair of horses for himself, and that it was only as an excuse","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"for assisting them.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Very likely,\" said Emma--\"nothing more likely. I know no man more","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"likely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing--to do any thing","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"really good-natured, useful, considerate, or benevolent. He is not a","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"gallant man, but he is a very humane one; and this, considering Jane","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Fairfax's ill-health, would appear a case of humanity to him;--and for","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"an act of unostentatious kindness, there is nobody whom I would fix on","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"more than on Mr. Knightley. I know he had horses to-day--for we arrived","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"together; and I laughed at him about it, but he said not a word that","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"could betray.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Well,\" said Mrs. Weston, smiling, \"you give him credit for more simple,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do; for while Miss","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Bates was speaking, a suspicion darted into my head, and I have never","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"been able to get it out again. The more I think of it, the more probable","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"it appears. In short, I have made a match between Mr. Knightley and Jane","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Fairfax.

She might talk on; and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"if he wanted to say any thing himself, he would only talk louder, and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"drown her voice. But the question is not, whether it would be a bad","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"connexion for him, but whether he wishes it; and I think he does. I have","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"heard him speak, and so must you, so very highly of Jane Fairfax! The","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"interest he takes in her--his anxiety about her health--his concern that","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"she should have no happier prospect!

Frank Churchill, of whom, in the eagerness of her","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"conversation with Mrs. Weston, she had been seeing nothing, except that","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax, followed Mr. Cole, to add his very","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"pressing entreaties; and as, in every respect, it suited Emma best to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"lead, she gave a very proper compliance.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"She knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"she could perform with credit; she wanted neither taste nor spirit in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the little things which are generally acceptable, and could accompany","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"her own voice well. One accompaniment to her song took her agreeably by","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"surprize--a second, slightly but correctly taken by Frank Churchill. Her","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"pardon was duly begged at the close of the song, and every thing usual","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"followed. He was accused of having a delightful voice, and a perfect","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"knowledge of music; which was properly denied; and that he knew nothing","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of the matter, and had no voice at all, roundly asserted. They sang","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"together once more; and Emma would then resign her place to Miss","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Fairfax, whose performance, both vocal and instrumental, she never could","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"attempt to conceal from herself, was infinitely superior to her own.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"With mixed feelings, she seated herself at a little distance from the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"numbers round the instrument, to listen. Frank Churchill sang again.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"They had sung together once or twice, it appeared, at Weymouth. But the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"sight of Mr. Knightley among the most attentive, soon drew away half","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Emma's mind; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Mrs. Weston's suspicions, to which the sweet sounds of the united voices","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"gave only momentary interruptions. Her objections to Mr. Knightley's","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"marrying did not in the least subside. She could see nothing but evil","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"in it. It would be a great disappointment to Mr. John Knightley;","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"consequently to Isabella. A real injury to the children--a most","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"mortifying change, and material loss to them all;--a very great","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"deduction from her father's daily comfort--and, as to herself, she could","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"not at all endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey. A Mrs.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Knightley for them all to give way to!--No--Mr. Knightley must never","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"marry. Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Presently Mr. Knightley looked back, and came and sat down by her. They","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"talked at first only of the performance. His admiration was certainly","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"very warm; yet she thought, but for Mrs. Weston, it would not have","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"struck her. As a sort of touchstone, however, she began to speak of his","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"kindness in conveying the aunt and niece; and though his answer was in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the spirit of cutting the matter short, she believed it to indicate only","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"I often feel concern,\" said she, \"that I dare not make our carriage","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"more useful on such occasions.

I should have","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"expected better judgment in Colonel Campbell.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"From that moment, Emma could have taken her oath that Mr. Knightley had","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"had no concern in giving the instrument. But whether he were","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"entirely free from peculiar attachment--whether there were no actual","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"preference--remained a little longer doubtful. Towards the end of Jane's","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"second song, her voice grew thick.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"That will do,\" said he, when it was finished, thinking aloud--\"you have","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"sung quite enough for one evening--now be quiet.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Another song, however, was soon begged for. \"One more;--they would not","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account, and would only ask for one more.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"And Frank Churchill was heard to say, \"I think you could manage this","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"without effort; the first part is so very trifling.

Mrs. Weston,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"capital in her country-dances, was seated, and beginning an irresistible","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"waltz; and Frank Churchill, coming up with most becoming gallantry to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Emma, had secured her hand, and led her up to the top.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"While waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Emma found time, in spite of the compliments she was receiving on","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"her voice and her taste, to look about, and see what became of Mr.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Knightley. This would be a trial. He was no dancer in general. If he","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"were to be very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now, it might augur","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"something. There was no immediate appearance. No; he was talking to Mrs.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Cole--he was looking on unconcerned; Jane was asked by somebody else,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and he was still talking to Mrs. Cole.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Emma had no longer an alarm for Henry; his interest was yet safe; and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment. Not more than","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"five couple could be mustered; but the rarity and the suddenness of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"it made it very delightful, and she found herself well matched in a","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"partner.

She doubted whether she had not","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"transgressed the duty of woman by woman, in betraying her suspicions of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Jane Fairfax's feelings to Frank Churchill. It was hardly right; but it","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"had been so strong an idea, that it would escape her, and his submission","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to all that she told, was a compliment to her penetration, which made","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"tongue.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax; and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"there she had no doubt. She did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"inferiority of her own playing and singing. She did most heartily","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"grieve over the idleness of her childhood--and sat down and practised","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"vigorously an hour and a half.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"She was then interrupted by Harriet's coming in; and if Harriet's praise","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"could have satisfied her, she might soon have been comforted.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Oh! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax!\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Don't class us together, Harriet. My playing is no more like her's,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"than a lamp is like sunshine.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Oh! dear--I think you play the best of the two. I think you play quite","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"as well as she does. I am sure I had much rather hear you. Every body","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"last night said how well you played.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Those who knew any thing about it, must have felt the difference. The","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"truth is, Harriet, that my playing is just good enough to be praised,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"but Jane Fairfax's is much beyond it.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Well, I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does, or","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out. Mr. Cole","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"said how much taste you had; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked a great deal","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"about your taste, and that he valued taste much more than execution.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Ah! but Jane Fairfax has them both, Harriet.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Are you sure?

And I hate Italian singing.--There is no","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"understanding a word of it. Besides, if she does play so very well, you","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"know, it is no more than she is obliged to do, because she will have to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"teach.

The scene enlarged; two persons","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"appeared; Mrs. Weston and her son-in-law; they were walking into","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Highbury;--to Hartfield of course. They were stopping, however, in the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"first place at Mrs. Bates's; whose house was a little nearer","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Randalls than Ford's; and had all but knocked, when Emma caught their","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"eye.--Immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her; and the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"agreeableness of yesterday's engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the present meeting.

At","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"last it was all settled, even to the destination of the parcel.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Should I send it to Mrs. Goddard's, ma'am?\" asked Mrs.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Ford.--\"Yes--no--yes, to Mrs. Goddard's.

How","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"do you do, Miss Smith?--Very well I thank you.--And I begged Mrs. Weston","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to come with me, that I might be sure of succeeding.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are--\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Very well, I am much obliged to you. My mother is delightfully well;","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and Jane caught no cold last night. How is Mr. Woodhouse?--I am so glad","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to hear such a good account. Mrs. Weston told me you were here.--Oh!","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"then, said I, I must run across, I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"just to run across and entreat her to come in; my mother will be so","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"very happy to see her--and now we are such a nice party, she cannot","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"refuse.--'Aye, pray do,' said Mr. Frank Churchill, 'Miss Woodhouse's","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"opinion of the instrument will be worth having.'--But, said I, I shall","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me.--'Oh,' said","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"he, 'wait half a minute, till I have finished my job;'--For, would you","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"believe it, Miss Woodhouse, there he is, in the most obliging manner in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the world, fastening in the rivet of my mother's spectacles.--The rivet","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"came out, you know, this morning.--So very obliging!--For my mother had","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"no use of her spectacles--could not put them on. And, by the bye, every","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"body ought to have two pair of spectacles; they should indeed. Jane said","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"so. I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"but something or other hindered me all the morning; first one thing,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"then another, there is no saying what, you know. At one time Patty came","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping. Oh, said I,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Patty do not come with your bad news to me. Here is the rivet of your","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"mistress's spectacles out. Then the baked apples came home, Mrs. Wallis","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"sent them by her boy; they are extremely civil and obliging to us, the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Wallises, always--I have heard some people say that Mrs. Wallis can be","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"uncivil and give a very rude answer, but we have never known any thing","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"but the greatest attention from them. And it cannot be for the value","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of our custom now, for what is our consumption of bread, you know?","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Only three of us.--besides dear Jane at present--and she really eats","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"nothing--makes such a shocking breakfast, you would be quite frightened","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"if you saw it. I dare not let my mother know how little she eats--so I","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"say one thing and then I say another, and it passes off. But about the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"middle of the day she gets hungry, and there is nothing she likes so","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"well as these baked apples, and they are extremely wholesome, for I took","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry; I happened to meet","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"him in the street. Not that I had any doubt before--I have so often","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple. I believe it is the only","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome. We","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"have apple-dumplings, however, very often. Patty makes an excellent","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"apple-dumpling. Well, Mrs. Weston, you have prevailed, I hope, and these","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"ladies will oblige us.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Emma would be \"very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates, &c.,\" and they did at","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"last move out of the shop, with no farther delay from Miss Bates than,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"How do you do, Mrs. Ford? I beg your pardon. I did not see you before.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town. Jane","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"came back delighted yesterday. Thank ye, the gloves do very well--only a","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"little too large about the wrist; but Jane is taking them in.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"What was I talking of?\" said she, beginning again when they were all in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the street.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Emma wondered on what, of all the medley, she would fix.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of.--Oh! my mother's","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"spectacles. So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill! 'Oh!' said he,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"'I do think I can fasten the rivet; I like a job of this kind","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"excessively.'--Which you know shewed him to be so very.... Indeed I must","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"say that, much as I had heard of him before and much as I had expected,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"he very far exceeds any thing.... I do congratulate you, Mrs. Weston,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"most warmly. He seems every thing the fondest parent could....","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"'Oh!' said he, 'I can fasten the rivet. I like a job of that sort","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"excessively.' I never shall forget his manner. And when I brought out","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the baked apples from the closet, and hoped our friends would be so very","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"obliging as to take some, 'Oh!' said he directly, 'there is nothing","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"in the way of fruit half so good, and these are the finest-looking","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"home-baked apples I ever saw in my life.' That, you know, was so","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"very.... And I am sure, by his manner, it was no compliment. Indeed they","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"are very delightful apples, and Mrs. Wallis does them full justice--only","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"we do not have them baked more than twice, and Mr. Woodhouse made us","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"promise to have them done three times--but Miss Woodhouse will be so","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"good as not to mention it. The apples themselves are the very finest","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"sort for baking, beyond a doubt; all from Donwell--some of Mr.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Knightley's most liberal supply. He sends us a sack every year; and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"trees--I believe there is two of them. My mother says the orchard was","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"always famous in her younger days. But I was really quite shocked the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"other day--for Mr. Knightley called one morning, and Jane was eating","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"these apples, and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"them, and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock. 'I","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"am sure you must be,' said he, 'and I will send you another supply; for","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"I have a great many more than I can ever use. William Larkins let me","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"keep a larger quantity than usual this year. I will send you some more,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"before they get good for nothing.' So I begged he would not--for really","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"as to ours being gone, I could not absolutely say that we had a great","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"many left--it was but half a dozen indeed; but they should be all kept","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"for Jane; and I could not at all bear that he should be sending us more,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"so liberal as he had been already; and Jane said the same. And when","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"he was gone, she almost quarrelled with me--No, I should not say","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"quarrelled, for we never had a quarrel in our lives; but she was quite","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"distressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone; she wished","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"I had made him believe we had a great many left. Oh, said I, my dear,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"I did say as much as I could. However, the very same evening William","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Larkins came over with a large basket of apples, the same sort of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"apples, a bushel at least, and I was very much obliged, and went down","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and spoke to William Larkins and said every thing, as you may suppose.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"William Larkins is such an old acquaintance! I am always glad to see","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"him. But, however, I found afterwards from Patty, that William said it","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"was all the apples of _that_ sort his master had; he had brought them","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"all--and now his master had not one left to bake or boil.

Ten couple, in either of the Randalls","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"rooms, would have been insufferable!--Dreadful!--I felt how right you","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"were the whole time, but was too anxious for securing _any_ _thing_","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to like to yield.

However,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"this does make a difference; and, perhaps, when we come to talk it","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"over--but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration. One","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"cannot resolve upon them in a hurry. If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"obliging as to call here one morning, we may talk it over, and see what","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"can be done.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"But, unfortunately, sir, my time is so limited--\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Oh!\" interrupted Emma, \"there will be plenty of time for talking every","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"thing over.

He came four times a day","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"for a week. He said, from the first, it was a very good sort--which","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"was our great comfort; but the measles are a dreadful complaint.

There were Mr. and Mrs.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Weston; delighted to see her and receive her approbation, very busy and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"very happy in their different way; she, in some little distress; and he,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"finding every thing perfect.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Emma,\" said she, \"this paper is worse than I expected.

At the time of the ballroom's being built,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"suppers had not been in question; and a small card-room adjoining, was","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the only addition. What was to be done? This card-room would be wanted","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"as a card-room now; or, if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"by their four selves, still was it not too small for any comfortable","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"supper? Another room of much better size might be secured for the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"purpose; but it was at the other end of the house, and a long awkward","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"passage must be gone through to get at it. This made a difficulty. Mrs.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage;","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and neither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"miserably crowded at supper.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Mrs. Weston proposed having no regular supper; merely sandwiches,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"&c., set out in the little room; but that was scouted as a wretched","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"suggestion. A private dance, without sitting down to supper, was","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women; and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Mrs. Weston must not speak of it again. She then took another line of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"expediency, and looking into the doubtful room, observed,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"I do not think it _is_ so very small.

She is still nearer.--And I do not know","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"whether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the rest of the people as any body.

All the rest, in speculation at","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"least, was perfectly smooth.

Indeed, when the time draws on, I shall decidedly recommend their","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"bringing the barouche-landau; it will be so very much preferable.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"When people come into a beautiful country of this sort, you know, Miss","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Woodhouse, one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible; and Mr.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Suckling is extremely fond of exploring. We explored to King's-Weston","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"twice last summer, in that way, most delightfully, just after their","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"first having the barouche-landau. You have many parties of that kind","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"here, I suppose, Miss Woodhouse, every summer?\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"No; not immediately here. We are rather out of distance of the very","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of; and we","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"are a very quiet set of people, I believe; more disposed to stay at home","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"than engage in schemes of pleasure.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Ah! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort. Nobody can","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"be more devoted to home than I am. I was quite a proverb for it at Maple","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Grove. Many a time has Selina said, when she has been going to Bristol,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"'I really cannot get this girl to move from the house. I absolutely must","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"go in by myself, though I hate being stuck up in the barouche-landau","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"without a companion; but Augusta, I believe, with her own good-will,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"would never stir beyond the park paling.' Many a time has she said so;","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and yet I am no advocate for entire seclusion. I think, on the contrary,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"when people shut themselves up entirely from society, it is a very","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"bad thing; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"a proper degree, without living in it either too much or too little. I","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"perfectly understand your situation, however, Miss Woodhouse--(looking","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"towards Mr. Woodhouse), Your father's state of health must be a great","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"drawback. Why does not he try Bath?--Indeed he should. Let me recommend","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Bath to you. I assure you I have no doubt of its doing Mr. Woodhouse","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"good.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"My father tried it more than once, formerly; but without receiving any","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"benefit; and Mr. Perry, whose name, I dare say, is not unknown to you,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Ah! that's a great pity; for I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, where the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"waters do agree, it is quite wonderful the relief they give. In my Bath","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"life, I have seen such instances of it! And it is so cheerful a place,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"that it could not fail of being of use to Mr. Woodhouse's spirits,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"which, I understand, are sometimes much depressed. And as to its","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"recommendations to _you_, I fancy I need not take much pains to dwell","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"on them. The advantages of Bath to the young are pretty generally","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"understood. It would be a charming introduction for you, who have lived","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"so secluded a life; and I could immediately secure you some of the best","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"society in the place. A line from me would bring you a little host of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"acquaintance; and my particular friend, Mrs. Partridge, the lady I have","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"always resided with when in Bath, would be most happy to shew you any","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"attentions, and would be the very person for you to go into public","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"with.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"It was as much as Emma could bear, without being impolite. The idea","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of her being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called an","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"_introduction_--of her going into public under the auspices of a friend","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of Mrs. Elton's--probably some vulgar, dashing widow, who, with the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"help of a boarder, just made a shift to live!--The dignity of Miss","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Woodhouse, of Hartfield, was sunk indeed!","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"She restrained herself, however, from any of the reproofs she could have","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"given, and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly; \"but their going to Bath was","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"quite out of the question; and she was not perfectly convinced that","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the place might suit her better than her father.\" And then, to prevent","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"farther outrage and indignation, changed the subject directly.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"I do not ask whether you are musical, Mrs. Elton. Upon these occasions,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"a lady's character generally precedes her; and Highbury has long known","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"that you are a superior performer.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Oh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea. A superior","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"performer!--very far from it, I assure you. Consider from how partial","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"a quarter your information came. I am doatingly fond of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"music--passionately fond;--and my friends say I am not entirely devoid","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of taste; but as to any thing else, upon my honour my performance is","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"_mediocre_ to the last degree. You, Miss Woodhouse, I well know, play","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"delightfully. I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"comfort, and delight to me, to hear what a musical society I am got","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"into. I absolutely cannot do without music. It is a necessary of life to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"me; and having always been used to a very musical society, both at","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Maple Grove and in Bath, it would have been a most serious sacrifice. I","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"honestly said as much to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"home, and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"disagreeable; and the inferiority of the house too--knowing what I had","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"been accustomed to--of course he was not wholly without apprehension.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"When he was speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that _the_","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"_world_ I could give up--parties, balls, plays--for I had no fear of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"retirement. Blessed with so many resources within myself, the world was","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"not necessary to _me_. I could do very well without it. To those who had","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"no resources it was a different thing; but my resources made me quite","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"independent. And as to smaller-sized rooms than I had been used to, I","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"really could not give it a thought. I hoped I was perfectly equal to any","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"sacrifice of that description. Certainly I had been accustomed to every","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"luxury at Maple Grove; but I did assure him that two carriages were not","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"necessary to my happiness, nor were spacious apartments. 'But,' said I,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"'to be quite honest, I do not think I can live without something of a","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"musical society. I condition for nothing else; but without music, life","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"would be a blank to me.'\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"We cannot suppose,\" said Emma, smiling, \"that Mr. Elton would hesitate","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to assure you of there being a _very_ musical society in Highbury; and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"I hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"pardoned, in consideration of the motive.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"No, indeed, I have no doubts at all on that head. I am delighted to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"find myself in such a circle. I hope we shall have many sweet little","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"concerts together. I think, Miss Woodhouse, you and I must establish a","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"musical club, and have regular weekly meetings at your house, or ours.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Will not it be a good plan? If _we_ exert ourselves, I think we shall","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"not be long in want of allies. Something of that nature would be","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"particularly desirable for _me_, as an inducement to keep me in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"practice; for married women, you know--there is a sad story against","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"them, in general. They are but too apt to give up music.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"But you, who are so extremely fond of it--there can be no danger,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"surely?\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"I should hope not; but really when I look around among my acquaintance,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"I tremble.

And the same may be said of Mrs.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Jeffereys--Clara Partridge, that was--and of the two Milmans, now Mrs.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Bird and Mrs. James Cooper; and of more than I can enumerate. Upon my","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"word it is enough to put one in a fright. I used to be quite angry with","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Selina; but really I begin now to comprehend that a married woman has","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"many things to call her attention.

She speaks a little too quick. A little","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear. But I believe","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"I am nice; I do not like strange voices; and nobody speaks like you and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"poor Miss Taylor.

The two eldest little","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"weeks in the spring, and their papa now proposed bringing them, and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"staying one whole day at Hartfield--which one day would be the very day","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of this party.--His professional engagements did not allow of his being","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"put off, but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"so. Mr. Woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"utmost that his nerves could bear--and here would be a ninth--and Emma","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"apprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"being able to come even to Hartfield for forty-eight hours without","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"falling in with a dinner-party.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"She comforted her father better than she could comfort herself, by","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"representing that though he certainly would make them nine, yet","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"he always said so little, that the increase of noise would be very","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"immaterial.

Instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"waited for dinner, he was talking to Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"as elegant as lace and pearls could make her, he looked at in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"silence--wanting only to observe enough for Isabella's information--but","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Miss Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl, and he could talk","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to her.

It was","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"natural to have some civil hopes on the subject, and he said,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"I hope you did not venture far, Miss Fairfax, this morning, or I am","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"sure you must have been wet.--We scarcely got home in time.

<p>Это потому что одна строка в тиббле это одна строка книги. Мы можем снова воспользоваться функцией <code>str_c()</code> и слить весь текст в одну гигантскую строку, но вместо этого мы токенизируем наши тексты, используя в качестве токенов (=смысловых единиц) слова. Если вы посмотрели видео в начале, то уже знаете, что такое токенизация, а если не посмотрели, то идите и посмотрите :)</p>
<p>Для токенизации мы будем использовать функцию <code>unnest_tokens()</code> из библиотеки <code>tidytext</code> (про эту библиотеку есть книга, которую можно прочитать <a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/">здесь</a>). В аргумент <code>output</code> функции <code>unnest_tokens()</code> подается вектор с именем будущей переменной, а аргумент <code>input</code> принимает имя переменной, в которой в нашем тиббле хранится текст. По умолчанию <code>unnest_tokens()</code> делит текст на слова, хотя есть и другие опции, которые можно указать в аргументе <code>token</code>. Но пока давайте поисследуем слова.</p>

<p><code>wordcloud</code>, к сожалению, не совместим с <code>ggplot2</code> без которого, например, гораздо сложнее сделать фасетизацию и не задолбаться. Зато есть библиотека <code>ggwordcloud</code>, в которой есть <code>geom_text_wordcloud</code>. Воспользуемся же им!</p>
<p>Предварительное предупреждение: если слов в облако надо вместить много, то `<code>ggwordcloud</code> указывает для редко встречающихся очень маленький размер шрифта. <code>ggplot</code> от этого волнуется и выдаёт ворнинги, по одному на каждое слово. Это я к чему: график в чанке снизу выдаёт миллион ворнингов. В этом мануале они спрятаны, а когда столкнётесь с ними при выполнении заданий, можете их игнорировать. И, конечно, совершенно не обязательно включать слова, которые встречаются всего пару раз в очень длинном тексте.</p>

<p>Поиск самых частотных слов — не единственная задача, которую можно решать при работе с текстом. Иногда имеет смысл узнать распределение слов в произведении. Давайте посмотрим как распределены в романе “Эмма” фамилии главных героев:</p>

<p>Функция <code>unnest_tokens()</code> позволяет работать не только со словами, но и, напрмиер, с n-граммами, то есть сочетаниями из n слов. Важно понимать, что n-граммы образуются “внахлёст”:</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> Визуализация биграмм с <code>igraph</code> и <code>ggraph</code></h2>
<p>Биграммы можно представить теми же способами, что и слова, а можно визуализировать сеть связей между словами в таком как бы графе. Для этого мы будем пользоваться двумя библиотеками: <code>igraph</code> и <code>ggraph</code>.</p>
<p>Из <code>igraph</code> нам понадобится функция <code>graph_from_data_frame()</code>, которой мы скормим тиббл с данными о частотности биграмм, а <code>ggraph</code> будем использовать, чтобы построить график.</p>
<p>Для графика нам нужно три переменных:
- from, от какого “узла” (слова) начинается связь
- to, в какой узел (слово) связь идёт
- weight, вес этой связи. В нашем случае - насколько часто эта связь (то есть, конкретная биграмма) встречается в тексте.</p>
<p><code>graph_from_data_frame()</code> берёт тиббл (или любой дата фрейм) с этой информацией и преобразует его в объект, из которого можно делать граф.</p>
<p>Давайте совершим все эти преобразования и заодно оставим только биграммы, которых больше 20:</p>

<p><code>udpipe</code> лемматизирует наш текст (то есть, теперь “мясо” и “мяса” распрознаются как одно и то же слово), а также помечает, к какой части речи это слово относится, по <a href="https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/index.html">универсальной классификации</a>. С таким текстом, например, можно посмотреть на то, как часто встречаются только определённые части речи.</p>
<p>И последний комментарий про <code>udpipe</code>: лемматизациz дело не быстрое, поэтому, скорее всего, лемматизировать все фанфики скопом у вас не получится. Вместо этого предлагается сделать сэмпл (то есть, рандомно выбрать, например, 300 фанфиков) и работать с ними. Если 300 вашему компьютеру тяжело - можно меньше. Соответственно, в заданиях, где нужна лемматизация, сэмплируйте датасет и работайте с сэмплом.</p>
<p>А теперь - собственно, задания!</p>
</div>
<div id="задания-1" class="section level2" number="5.7">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.7</span> Задания</h2>
<div class="rmdtask">
<p>
Найдите три самыx популярных (по количеству лайков) фанфика и постройте барплоты для самых часто встречающихся слов в этих фанфиках.
</p>
</div>
<div class="rmdtask">
<p>
Найдите самый длинный фанфик (не забывайте, что в нашем датасете одна строка это одна глава, а глав бывает несколько) и постройте для него граф биграмм (не всех, конечно, а тех, что встречаются чаще скольки-то раз).
</p>
</div>
<div class="rmdtask">
<p>
Для того же самого длинного фанфика по самым частотным словам поймите, какие в нём есть персонажи и как их зовут. Постройте график, который показывает, как частота появления разных персонажей меняется на протяжении фанфика.
</p>
</div>
<div class="rmdtask">
<p>
Какие прилагательные чаще всего используются в вашем фандоме со словом “глаз” (в любой форме)? Проиллюстрируйте облаком слов. Именно здесь вам понадобится лемматизация, так что используйте сэмпл.
</p>
</div>
<div class="rmdtask">
<p>
Найдите самого плодовитого автора в вашем фандоме (то есть, такого, который написал больше всего фанфиков). Попробуйте найти клише, которые встречаются в его или её текстах. Тут можно посмотреть на биграммы, триграммы или и то, и другое - посмотрите, что интереснее, и покажите на графике (можно барплот, можно сделать облако слов, можете придумать свой вариант).
</p>
</div>
<p>Если у вас появятся вопросы - смело задавайте их в канале #text-preprocessing-questions, а все странные и нелепые графики присылайте в #accidental-art. Удачи!</p>
